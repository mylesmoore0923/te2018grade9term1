// **** Problem 1 ****
// Store the sum of num1 and num2 in a variable.
// Print the sum.
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum);

// **** Problem 2 ****
// Store the difference between sum (above) and 7 in a variable.
// Print the difference.
let difference = sum - 7
console.log(difference)
// **** Problem 3 ****
// Store the product of difference and 3 in a variable.
// Print the product.
let product = num1 *num2
console.log(product)
// **** Problem 4 ****
// Store the power of the product raised to an exponent of 2 in a variable.
// Print the power.
let power=()
// **** Problem 5 ****
// Store the quotient of the power divided by 4 in a variable.
// Print the quotient.


// **** Problem 6 ****
// Store the remainder of the quotient divided by 2 in a variable.
// Print the remainder.


// **** Problem 7 ****
// Print a boolean value (true/false) representing if the quotient from
// problem 5 is even or odd. If the quotient is even, print true. If the
// quotient is odd, print false.
//
// Hint: You can tell if a value is even or odd if it is divisible by 2;
// in other words, if there is no remainder after dividing the value by
// 2, then the value is even. See problem 6!
